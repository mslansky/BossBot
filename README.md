This Project Was Built for the Social Justice Hackathon hosted by Mintbean.io and App Academy.

The purpose of this application is to allow for the User to practice salary negotiations. 

BOSSBOT allows for the User to input conversation, and practice what they want to say. 
Linked adviced and a Hintbot are also included to help the User determine specifics.

BOSSBOT simulates a short, natural conversation that could take place. 

BOSSBOT was created with the intention of being specifically aware of the Gender Wage Gap. 
A study from Harvard concluded that:
"Gender differences in negotiation were also dependent on whether there was an explicit statement that wages were negotiable. 
The authors found that when there was no explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men were more likely to negotiate 
than women." 

The hope behind BOSSBOT is that anyone can use it to become more confident in thier arguements. 
The intention is : If a User is able to successful practice beforehand, they will be more comfortable to successfully approach a conversation regarding higher compensation.
